# Moustache Escapes Property Finder - Submission

## Initial Thought Process and Problem Breakdown

When I first read the problem statement, I approached it by breaking it down into these core components:

1. **Data Management**
   - Storing property data with locations and coordinates
   - Organizing data for efficient access and searching

2. **Location Services**
   - Converting user input locations to coordinates (geocoding)
   - Handling spelling mistakes and variations in location names
   - Calculating distances between points

3. **Search Logic**
   - Finding properties within 50km radius
   - Sorting results by distance
   - Handling edge cases (no properties found, invalid locations)

4. **API Design**
   - Creating a clean, RESTful API interface
   - Ensuring fast response times
   - Implementing proper error handling
   - Adding documentation

## Tools and Libraries Used

1. **FastAPI**
   - Chosen for its modern, async-first approach
   - Automatic OpenAPI documentation
   - Type checking and validation with Pydantic
   - High performance and easy to scale

2. **Geopy**
   - Reliable geocoding with Nominatim provider
   - Accurate distance calculations using geodesic distance
   - Well-maintained and widely used in production

3. **RapidFuzz**
   - Fast and accurate fuzzy string matching
   - Better performance than traditional Levenshtein distance
   - Handles Indian location names well

4. **CacheTools**
   - Simple TTL caching for geocoding results
   - Reduces API calls and improves response times
   - Memory-efficient implementation

## Key Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge was balancing accuracy with performance, particularly in these areas:

1. **Location Name Variations**
   - Challenge: Users might input location names with spelling mistakes or in different formats
   - Solution: Implemented fuzzy matching with a 75% similarity threshold and added common variations to the known locations list

2. **Response Time Optimization**
   - Challenge: Geocoding API calls were slowing down responses
   - Solution: 
     - Added 24-hour TTL caching for geocoding results
     - Pre-stored coordinates for all properties
     - Optimized distance calculations

3. **Error Handling**
   - Challenge: Various edge cases like invalid locations, network issues
   - Solution: 
     - Implemented comprehensive error handling
     - Added informative error messages
     - Created a health check endpoint

## Future Improvements

Given more time, I would explore these enhancements:

1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement spatial indexing for faster nearby property searches
   - Add Redis caching for frequently searched locations
   - Use batch geocoding for multiple locations

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Add property filters (price range, amenities)
   - Implement reverse search (find locations near a property)
   - Add support for multiple languages in location names

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
   - Add monitoring and logging
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Deploy using Docker containers

4. **Data Improvements**
   - Add more property details (images, pricing, amenities)
   - Implement real-time availability updates
   - Add support for seasonal pricing variations

## Testing and Validation

The solution includes comprehensive testing:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Performance testing for response times
- Edge case handling for various scenarios
